==================================

.. contents:: Overview

These 6 Plone 5 posters are part of the main launch campaign media.

This is the base copytext manuscript for translation and contains additional information for translators or creators of derivative media.


General Information
===================

The initial release of his copytext is based on the first posters release for the Plone 5 launch available at the Plone Conference Bucharest 2015 and available for download on https://plone.org

Spirit
------

* Make sure you keep the spirit of the campaign for your local audience.
* If citing a different author makes more sense in your cultural continent feel free to replace Shakespeare with Goethe, Schiller, Mandela or Bocuse but do not fool around. Keep it serious. There are areas in the world, not everybody knows Jesus or Rock\`n Roll.
* When using famous author quotes, keep copyright in mind. In general, a classical author is safe to use, but Mexico for instance has a lifetime + 100 years limit.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries'_copyright_lengths

Starting a translation job
==========================

The text is intended for translation and citing purposes.

.. hint:: Contribute your translation as text

    Please contribute the manuscript of the translation as a branch on github. So first checkout this manuscript in english and contribute back as a translated file.


.. hint:: Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape?

    Try to ask someone who has Adobe Illustrator to edit the master.

    Make sure you start with the AI master file when working on the graphics!
    The file contains 6 Artboards and predefined Paragraph Styles.

    So you can easily write out all Posters as PDF in one shot.

    If you can only use Open Source SVG Editing Software like Inkscape, you loose a lot of benefits and make your work harder but not impossible. Finishing rules!


Common Footer Text
==================

The footer text is in the manuscript.

You may translate the copyright for your country, but not need to.

If a local URL makes sense for a campaign, talk to the plone.com communication team how to set up a localized landing page. Prefer to use plone.com/de and a redirect to your localized site in case you fail to maintain a local domain.

Common claim
============

If you need a common Plone 5 claim for all posters together use:

    "Built with passion"

Other appications available
===========================

We are creating an exhibition banner featuring all 6 topics.

Available asap.
